We have to use MySql (per project requirements), going to use it with the MySQL connector for Python. 

UI won't get us any extra points, so feel free to do what you want, but don't waste your time on it if there are other things to do.

Things to be done:
* Create login abilities
* Carry logged-in account to do things
* Pretty much all requests, while being logged in
* regex to disallow bad input from registering users
